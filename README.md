# Blood Donation Prediction
Warm Up: Predict Blood Donations Driven Data Competition/ Artificial Neural Networks

A work in progress...

I used a feedforward neural network

I have tried using a dropout but hasn't been effective with this model
When I tweak the hidden node values there seems to be a difference in the accuracy

# Dependensies 
- [ ] Numpy
- [ ] Matplotlib(IF YOU WANT TO display trends, I put a # on them to help with processing speed)
- [ ] Scikit Learn
- [ ] Keras
- [ ] Tensorflow
- [ ] Math
- [ ] Pandas

## Steps
- [x] Import dependencies
- [x] Load Training Features Data
- [x] Turn data into a pandas data frame and Display
- [x] Replace the strings in thal column with corresponding numbers
- [x] Turn features into numpy arrays  
- [x] Check shape
- [x] Split the model 
- [x] Build the Model
- [x] Compile
- [x] Fit and train
- [x] Let's Evaluate Our Model with the loss function and accuracy
